# Electrode

Electrode is a no-configuration status bar for Wayland compositors.

You can try it out with the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/) and Flakes:

```sh
nix run github:danth/electrode
```

Building it directly with Cargo should work, too, provided you have GTK3
development packages installed.

Proper instructions will follow when the bar is more developed.

## Why the name?

It looks a bit like the end of this phone battery.
